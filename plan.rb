# Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

# Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.
# The game doesnâ€™t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other playerâ€™s score is.


# ---classes---

# store player info like name, remaining lives.
class Player #(name?)
  def initialize
    @lives = 3
  end
end

# contain the game loop
class Game
  def initialize
    @player1 = Player.new
    @player2 = Player.new
    @current_player = 'Player 1' # manage whose turn it is
  end


# main loop: runs until either player reaches 0 lives
